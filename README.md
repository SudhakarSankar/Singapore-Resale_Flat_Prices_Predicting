Singapore_HDB_Resale_Price_Prediction
ðŸ“Œ HDB Resale Flat Price Prediction

ðŸ“– Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict resale prices of Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats in Singapore. The model helps buyers and sellers estimate flat prices based on historical transaction data, considering various influencing factors.

ðŸ“Š Key Features
âœ” Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gathered resale flat transaction data from HDB and cleaned it for modeling.
âœ” Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features like town, flat type, storey range, floor area, lease commence date, and flat model.
âœ” Machine Learning Models:
Â Â Â Â  ðŸ”¹ Regression: Predicted resale prices using Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Linear Regression.
âœ” Model Evaluation: Assessed performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
âœ” Streamlit App: Built an interactive web application for user-friendly price prediction.
âœ” Deployment: Hosted the application on Render for public access.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
ðŸŸ¢ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
ðŸŸ¢ Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
ðŸŸ¢ Streamlit (Web Deployment)
ðŸŸ¢ Pickle (Model Storage)

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
ðŸ“Œ Price Influencers: Location, flat type, floor area, and lease commencement date significantly impact resale prices.
ðŸ“Œ Market Trends: Analyzing historical data helps in understanding price fluctuations and trends.
ðŸ“Œ Model Accuracy: Regression models effectively estimate flat prices with reduced errors.

ðŸš€ Future Improvements
âœ” Enhance model accuracy with deep learning techniques.
âœ” Incorporate additional features such as proximity to MRT stations and amenities.
âœ” Deploy as a scalable web service using Flask/FastAPI.
